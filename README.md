# Numerical-Analysis-With-Python

I took MATH 407 Numerical Analysis at Illinois Wesleyan University during Fall 2018.
Even though the numerical methods can be found in the Sympy Python library, I implemented these numerical methods in Python to learn the algorithms behind these methods.
MATH 407 Numerical Analysis Course Description: Numerical processes and error estimates relating to non-linear equations, linear systems of equations, polynomial interpolation and approximation, spline functions, numerical integration and differentiation, and initial-value problems in ordinary differential equations.
Textbook Used: Numerical Analysis by Burden and Faires (8th Edition)
